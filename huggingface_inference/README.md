# IndicTrans2 HF Compatible Models

In this section, we provide details on how to use our [IndicTrans2](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/IndicTrans2) models which were originally trained with the [fairseq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq) to [HuggingFace transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) for inference purpose. Our scripts for HuggingFace compatible models are adapted from [M2M100 repository](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/src/transformers/models/m2m_100).


### Setup

To get started, follow these steps to set up the environment:

```
# Clone the github repository and navigate to the project directory.
git clone https://github.com/AI4Bharat/IndicTrans2
cd IndicTrans2

# Install all the dependencies and requirements associated with the project for running HF compatible models.
source install.sh
```

> Note: The `install.sh` script in this directory is specifically for running HF compatible models for inference.


### Converting

In order to convert the fairseq checkpoint to a PyTorch checkpoint that is compatible with HuggingFace Transformers, use the following command:

```bash
python3 convert_indictrans_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py --fairseq_path <fairseq_checkpoint_best.pt> --pytorch_dump_folder_path <hf_output_dir>
```
- `<fairseq_checkpoint_best.pt>`: path to the fairseq `checkpoint_best.pt` that needs to be converted to HF compatible models
- `<hf_output_dir>`: path to the output directory where the HF compatible models will be saved


### Models

| Model    | ðŸ¤— HuggingFace Checkpoints        |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| Preprint En-Indic | [ai4bharat/indictrans2-en-indic-1B](https://huggingface.co/ai4bharat/indictrans2-en-indic-1B) |
| Preprint Indic-En | [ai4bharat/indictrans2-indic-en-1B](https://huggingface.co/ai4bharat/indictrans2-indic-en-1B) |


### Inference

With the conversion complete, you can now perform inference using the HuggingFace Transformers. 

You can start with the provided `example.py` script and customize it for your specific translation use case:

```bash
python3 example.py
```

Feel free to modify the `example.py` script to suit your translation needs.
