# IndicTrans2 HF Compatible Models

[![colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AI4Bharat/IndicTrans2/blob/main/huggingface_interface/colab_inference.ipynb)

In this section, we provide details on how to use our [IndicTrans2](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/IndicTrans2) models which were originally trained with the [fairseq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq) to [HuggingFace transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) for inference purpose. Our scripts for HuggingFace compatible models are adapted from [M2M100 repository](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/src/transformers/models/m2m_100).

> Note: We have migrated IndicTrans2 tokenizer for HF compatible IndicTrans2 models to [IndicTransTokenizer](https://github.com/VarunGumma/IndicTransTokenizer) and will be maintained separately there from now onwards. This is automatically installed when you call `install.sh` script in `huggingface_interface`.

### Setup

To get started, follow these steps to set up the environment:

```
# Clone the github repository and navigate to the project directory.
git clone https://github.com/AI4Bharat/IndicTrans2
cd IndicTrans2/huggingface_interface

# Install all the dependencies and requirements associated with the project for running HF compatible models.
source install.sh
```

> Note: The `install.sh` script in this directory is specifically for running HF compatible models for inference.

### Converting

In order to convert the fairseq checkpoint to a PyTorch checkpoint that is compatible with HuggingFace Transformers, use the following command:

```bash
python3 convert_indictrans_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py --fairseq_path <fairseq_checkpoint_best.pt> --pytorch_dump_folder_path <hf_output_dir>
```

- `<fairseq_checkpoint_best.pt>`: path to the fairseq `checkpoint_best.pt` that needs to be converted to HF compatible models
- `<hf_output_dir>`: path to the output directory where the HF compatible models will be saved

### Inference

With the conversion complete, you can now perform inference using the HuggingFace Transformers.

You can start with the provided `example.py` script and customize it for your specific translation use case:

```bash
python3 example.py
```

Feel free to modify the `example.py` script to suit your translation needs.

### Fine-tuning with LoRA

Before starting with fine-tuning IndicTrans2 models, you will need to restructure the training data in the following format.

```
en-indic-exp
â”œâ”€â”€ train
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ eng_Latn-asm_Beng
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ train.eng_Latn
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ train.asm_Beng
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ eng_Latn-ben_Beng
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ {src_lang}-{tgt_lang}
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ train.{src_lang}
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ train.{tgt_lang}
â””â”€â”€ dev
    â”œâ”€â”€ eng_Latn-asm_Beng
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dev.eng_Latn
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dev.asm_Beng
    â”œâ”€â”€ eng_Latn-ben_Beng
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
    â””â”€â”€ {src_lang}-{tgt_lang}
        â”œâ”€â”€ dev.{src_lang}
        â””â”€â”€ dev.{tgt_lang}
```

Once you have data ready in above specified format, use the following command.

```bash
bash train_lora.sh <data_dir> <model_name> <output_dir> <direction> <src_lang_list> <tgt_lang_list>
```

We recommend you to refer to `train_lora.sh` for defaults arguments for fine-tuning. Please note that the specified hyperparameters may not be optimal and might require tuning for your use case.

### Inference with LoRA

You can load the LoRA adapters with the base model for inference by modifying the model initialization in `example.py` script.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM
from peft import PeftConfig, PeftModel

base_ckpt_dir = "ai4bharat/indictrans2-en-indic-1B" # you will need to change as per your use case
base_model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(base_ckpt_dir, trust_remote_code=True)
lora_model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, lora_ckpt_dir)
```

> Note: Please feel free to open issues on the GitHub repo in case of any queries/issues.
